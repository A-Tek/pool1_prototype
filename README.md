# [A-TEK Inc Prototype](http://52.5.25.227/)


##**1. Summary**
A-TEK is extremely pleased to submit a proposal for the GSA Agile Services contract. We understand the detailed requirements of the IDIQ contractor. We possess the proven methodology and technology experience to support F18Ã­s vision for executing the IDIQ and task orders. The following sections describe our Agile Approach and Technical Approach for the prototype.   
  
##**2. Prototype Methodology**

#####**2.1 Scrum Agile Approach**

Applying the Scrum Agile methodology, we designed, developed, and tested the agileTek prototype; allowing us to highlight our agile capabilities and process maturities. The following information defines the high-level Scrum methodology utilized for this prototype.

We assigned a Product Manager, Agile Coach, Scrum Master, UI Experts, and Developers to design, develop, and test the prototype. The Product Manager role defines the requirements, maintains and prioritizes the backlog, and approves the sprint cycles and prototype suggestions. 
We executed two sprints with a sprint duration of one week. As part of the first sprint, we included user stories, related user interface design, and technology selection. The second sprint included developing and delivering the prototype. Per our methodology guidelines, we conducted 15-minute daily-standup meetings and at the end of each sprint retrospectives. We delivered a total of 550 points for two sprints compared to the planned 600 points. Our approach included assigning external user roles to provide feedback on the prototype after each sprint. 



#####**2.2	User Centered Design Methodology**

We adopted a human-centered design methodology to identify, survey, and define the prototype requirements with external users. We created user personas and user walkthroughs as for sprint one. The following image offers a high-level user interface design approach.

With our proven approach, we can satisfy the goals and requirements of the prototype design. We believe every improvement in the area of user experience provides a win/win situation for the clients and end users, resulting in cost reductions and productivity increases. Our design methodology included a Product Manager, Front-End Developer, and Visual Designer to create initial personas, wireframes, and visual designs. Along with low fidelity and high fidelity designs we created a design style guide. 

The following defines the techniques used for our HCD approach:

* Created personas and user context story boarding.
* Created paper designs initially and low level wireframes to support story boarding. 
* Conducted simple open card sorting to review the navigation and design layouts.
* Included end users to participate early in the innovation process.

We conducted basic usability testing using google website optimizer by creating simple A/B testing techniques for basic navigation for high fidelity prototypes.


#####**2.3	Technology**
We built our prototype on end-to-end, complete open-source java script stack on an ubuntu platform hosted on Amazon IaaS server. We have used bootstrap-based responsive design techniques to support multiple devices and browsers. Using the end-to-end, complete open-source java script stack.

##**3. Benefits and Retrospective**
**The following list defines some of the benefits of our approach:**

* We were able to demonstrate our agile capabilities along with technical capabilities, while adopting continuous integration with unit tests; this helped us identify defects early and reduce time spent fixing dependency errors 
* Our Agile approach included a user experience design; which, helped us develop the approved and appropriate design. 
* We were able to prove our git and open source capabilities with the tools and technology selection. 


**Following defines areas of improvement for our approach:**

* We would have demonstrated our User Experience and Technology experience with more days allocated.
* Due to the schedule restriction, we only executed one sprint for the prototype. 

##**4. Installation Instructions**

### Prerequisites:

**Node.js** - Download & Install Node.js and npm package manager. or you can also use this GitHub Gist to install Node.js.
